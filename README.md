# About the project
#### This project aims to solve the classic 4-queens puzzle by utilizing a genetic algorithm, which is suitable for tackling combinatorial problems. It also demonstrates how the chessboard evolves through the multiple generations until the arrangement of the queens is finally valid

# Key Achievements
* Implemented a genetic algorithm with the encoding and decoding functions and the fitness function for 4-queens board 
* Went through observations, conclusions, and modifications to the implemented algorithm until it finally worked very properly
* Displayed the evolution process over the most fitting board during execution 
* Could solve 4-queens puzzle in no time requiring only 30 generations 


# Requirements
#### Any `Python` version should work!

# Execution
#### Locate `4_queens.py` and run the following command:
```
python 4_queens.py
```

# Demonstration
